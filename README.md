Fuel Consumption Prediction with Linear Regression
Overview
Welcome to the Fuel Consumption Prediction project repository! This project focuses on predicting fuel consumption using linear regression models. The dataset includes various attributes related to vehicles and their fuel consumption rates.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about fuel consumption and attributes related to vehicles. It includes features such as engine size, cylinders, horsepower, and highway/city fuel consumption rates.

Methodology
Simple Linear Regression
In simple linear regression, we analyze the relationship between one independent variable (e.g., engine size) and the dependent variable (fuel consumption). The analysis includes the following steps:

Data Preprocessing: Exploring the dataset, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables (if any), and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

Model Training: Training a simple linear regression model using the training data to learn the linear relationship between engine size and fuel consumption.

Model Evaluation: Evaluating the performance of the trained model using various metrics such as mean squared error, R-squared value, and others.

Multiple Linear Regression
In multiple linear regression, we analyze the relationship between multiple independent variables (e.g., engine size, horsepower) and the dependent variable (fuel consumption). The analysis includes similar steps as simple linear regression but with multiple predictors.
